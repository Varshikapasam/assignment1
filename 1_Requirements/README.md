Introduction: 
Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. Matrices is a mathematical entity where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. A lot of applications exist with matrices in real life. The major application lies in the software industry such as development of algorithms like path finder algorithms, image processing algorithms and many more. 
In this project, some of the basic matrix operations are presented where a user can select the operation to be performed on the matrix. Then the matrices with their size are entered. Note that only square matrices are being considered for the project.

Defining Our System: 
The system on the whole is viewed as a blackbox which accepts input of a single number. Then the mapping of the number is done so as to perform the appropriate function. Then the user will be prompted to enter the matrix size. After that the user is prompted to enter the matrix elements. The input is stored in 2D arrays which are dynamically allocated and passed to the respective functions. Then the output is printed on the screen. This whole process is in a loop until the user presses a key which will exit the program.

SWOT Analysis:

Strengths:
To find the sum, difference and product on a pair of matrices.

Weaknesses:
Limited number of operations defined. Restricted only to the square matrix. The maximum value of the matrix is restricted to the maximum value.

Opportunities:
To solve large matrix problems. Saves time on solving matrix problems in reasearch applications. Simple and efficient solution.

Threats:
possible for memory leaks. possibility of SIGTRAP error in some systems. Availability of better options in market.

Requirements:

High Level Requirements:

*User shall be able to specify the size of the matrix.
*user shall be able to add the matrices.
*User shal be able to subtract the matrices.
*User shall be able to multiply the matrices.
*User shall be able to find determinant, transpose and inverse of a matrix.

Low Level Requirements:

*User must specify the size of the matrix. The size specified is the dimensions of the square matrix.
*Addition of two matrices can be done.
*Subtraction of two matrices is implemented in the same manner as addition.
*Multiplication of two matrices is done on two square matrices of a specified size.
*The determinant of a single matrix of a specified size is implemented.
*The transpose of a single matrix operation is implemented.
*To find the inverse of a matrix, both the determinant function and transpose functions are used in it. The condition that a matrix is invertible is to check if the determinant of the matrix is equal to 0.
